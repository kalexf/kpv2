<h4>Welcome to Kanplan</h4>
  <p>This web app lets you build customised training plans for running and other types of exercise.
  This help page explains how to use the basic features of the app.</p>


<h4>Creating new activity types</h4>

  <p>The first step of building a plan is to create some activities. From the create new activity page, select an activity type from the list, and then enter its details. For most exercise types there is also the option of making the activity progressive, which means that you can set it's distance, duration or repetitions to increase every time the activity is performed, until its progression goal is reached.</p>
  <p>You will be able to see a list of any activities you create on the home screen. They can also be edited and deleted from here.</p>

  </p>  

<h4>Building a plan</h4>
<p>Once one or more activity types have been created you can schedule them on the create / edit plan page. The default plan length is 2 weeks per cycle, this can be changed on the preferences page. </p>

<h4>The home screen</h4>

<h4>Submitting activities.</h4>
<p>There are several ways to 'submit' activities once you ahve completed them. Firstly, if an activity is scheduled for the current day, there will be a link to submit that activity as completed under it's name on the home screen schedule. Secondly, under the activities list there is a link next to the anme of each activity for submitting any unscheduled activities. Lastly, when loggin in if there were any activities scheduled to be completed since your last login you will be shown an update screen where you can confirm if those acitivities were completed as scheduled.
